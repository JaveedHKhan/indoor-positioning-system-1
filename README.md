# Indoor-positioning-system

Developed end to end working prototype of Indoor positioning system using BLE Beacons by creating an app using Android studio. GPS does not work properly inside building therefore the need for indoor positioning arises. For providing the location-based services inside the building we have implemented the indoor positioning application in our project using the Bluetooth enabled beacons.
